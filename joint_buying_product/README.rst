Installation
============

This module contains a lazy dependency to the OCA ``web_tree_dynamic_colored_field``
module. (https://github.com/OCA/web/tree/12.0/web_tree_dynamic_colored_field)

If installed, the ``end_date`` of the orders and the grouped orders will be displayed
with an orange or a red background, depending on the remaining delay to enter the order.
